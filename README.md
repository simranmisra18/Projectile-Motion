# Location Detection

The aim of this project is to calculate and output the position of a given object, given its trajectory and initial 
coordinates. Further, the project visualizes the travel path that the object will be taking.

With this project we utilize the MATLAB concepts for complex computation and visualization. Functions about 
arithmetic with arrays were leant. Further, plotting and visualization techniques were practiced and revised. 
Functions were also made and used, thus implementing modularity and abstraction in MATLAB.
